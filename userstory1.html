        <h3>Why do we need this?</h3>

        <p class="col-md-8" >
          I’d like you to meet my friend Kiara.  Kiara lives in Brightmoor, Detroit, and has 6 people in her family. 
          She has 2 parents and 3 younger brothers; 2 of her little brothers are 6 and the other one is 13. 
          Both her Parents make 26,000$ a year and she works after school for 8.20$/hourly; 
          Together they make about 62,000 a year which is the amount needed for ONE person to have a satisfactory life. 
          Her parents are having a lot of trouble with paying for their household Necessities; This includes bills, food, clothes, Toiletries, entertainment, and much more. 
          What are they to do when their kids all need new shoes and jackets, what about that field trip their son kept reminding them about, not to mention rent is right around the corner.  
          Kiara notices her parents in the kitchen extremely overwhelmed and stressed out she wished there was a way she could help more. One day a company called Meal Ticket comes to her school. 
          She learns it is an app where other people can buy them food; Her parents would still have a lot to pay for but it would be nice to not have to deal with certain things. 
          She takes home the form and turns it in the next day to her teacher. At first, nothing happened but then one day she hears a knock on the door; 
          When she opens the door a bunch of groceries is on her porch. There are so many different foods in the bags, even branded food like Oreos which she would only have gotten if she traded with her friends at lunch. 
          A feeling of relief rushed over her parents knowing that they didn’t need to pay for groceries for the month and could send their kids to school with better lunches. 
          Kiara and her family are extremely happy and thankful that Meal Ticket exists.

            So why do we need this? We need something like this because there are families where both parents and a child are working and they either are making enough for what they need or barely making it. 
            I want to make it so families like Kiars’s have an easier time dealing with an absolute necessity like food so they can focus their attention on stuff like rent and clothes.
